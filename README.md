# ENSF 400: Final Project

For this project, we are using the following repository as our base app, this has been produced by a team member of ours: https://github.com/Umar5426/PlayPongW-Ai

## Plan on using git workflows to collaborate with team mates

Step 1: The main branch will remain stable and will only contain code that has been reviewed and tested. Any new features will be developed on branches.

Step 2: Once the feature has been developed in the separate branch, a member of the team will push the code to the branch on github and create a pull request.

Step 3: Other members of the team will review and test the code and suggest any changes that may need to be made.

Step 4: Once the code is reviewed and tested, and the team is happy with it, the branch will be merged to main.

Step 5: To keep the repository clean, once the branch has been merged, it will be deleted.

This process will be repeated for each new feature.
